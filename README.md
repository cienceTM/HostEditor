**Note:** Do not use the normal settings changer after using HostEditor. First, adjust any settings not editable in HostEditor, then use HostEditor. If you encounter a Unity error or repeated kicks from creating a new lobby, the only solution I’m aware of is to join a friend’s lobby or use a different device. Once you become the host, you can use the normal settings editor to resolve the kick issue.

**Note:** I am not responsible for any consequences to your *Among Us* account if you use this tool.

# HostEditor

HostEditor is a memory trainer cheat designed for Among Us. 
Please ensure that you are the only player in the lobby before making any changes to the settings. 
Once adjustments are made, other players can join the lobby.
